### FILES included

- exams
- homework
- project 1 (MATLAB)
- project 2 (C)
- project 3 (C++)



### What else I want to say

Just to record my contribution in VG101. As I don't know whether my desktop will break down or not because I use Ubuntu and Windows together. I upload this mainly to help my roomates(D21 Room205), and also help students who will take VG101 in the future.

Hope this can be helpful.
